# 🇺🇦 Humanitarian Logistics in Conflict Zones: Lessons from the Ukraine War

> **A real-world, data-informed case study on building and optimizing humanitarian supply chains during high-intensity conflict.**

## 📦 Project Overview

This repository documents the research, data, methods, and tools used in a civilian humanitarian initiative delivering over **456 tons of medical and essential supplies** to Ukraine during the 2022 conflict.

The project explores how agile logistics, natural language processing (NLP), SWOT analysis, and field-tested frameworks can be combined to enable fast, secure, and adaptable humanitarian pipelines in volatile environments.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **RETEX-Based Methodology**: Structured experience feedback aligned with civilian and military logistics protocols.
- **NLP Sentiment & Emotion Analysis**: Volunteer responses were analyzed using AFINN, BING, and NRC lexicons.
- **SWOT + PESTLE Diagnostics**: Internal and external factors were rigorously analyzed to uncover optimization levers.
- **Inventory + Volunteer Data Tools**: Reproducible scripts for generating logistics tables, timelines, and response analytics.
- **Impact vs. Feasibility Matrix**: A strategic tool to prioritize future interventions.
