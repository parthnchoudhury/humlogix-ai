No space, no employees, or occasionally an excessive number of pointless donations—even though there are never too many—are all examples. However, it was only the beginning; everyone donated anything and everything, and it took a long time to arrange everything.
Sorting the drugs was the hardest thing for me to do. Between useless and expired drugs, etc.

The primary challenge is also the one that we should focus on improving: the rush to do tasks fast, which can result in mistakes, exhaustion, moments of confusion, and loadings that aren't always optimal.
