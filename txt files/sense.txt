I have a variety of reasons for doing things. I read a great deal of books about the Holocaust and the various global wars. I pondered—and still ponder—what action I would have taken in that situation. I therefore changed my query to reflect the present circumstances in response. To the extent that it was within my means, I made the decision to take action for people in need. I wanted to find a non-violent solution that would benefit civilians in both Russia and Ukraine.
The massive amount of donations and the mobilization that we witnessed on TV moved me, but I couldn't contribute anything, so I made the decision to get engaged in another way besides providing money.
Just helping, whenever we get the chance to do so with the faculty, is what I prefer to do (marauding, etc.). I will admit that I have a special bond with Ukraine because of our families and origins, but other projects for other nations would have undoubtedly piqued my attention as well.
In other words, we had no limitations and were able to assist those who were in great pain (at least for me).
As a friend of Arsène and a nurse, I became interested in this endeavor. Even though I felt powerless at my level, I still wanted to do something to support him and Ukraine in particular.
My goal was to use my skills to support a group effort in order to aid a people that were being attacked.
