While I did not actively participate in the conflict (that is, I did not supply weapons), I am grateful that I was able to be a part of an operation that allowed for the treatment of suffering people. After that, I took part in a mission with Gynecology Without Borders to provide pregnancy and gynecological follow-up services to Ukrainian refugees.
a little planning and coordination, as well as cooperation amongst participants
excellent
It feels good to be of use.
The most striking thing to me was the outpouring of solidarity, something I found to be nearly nonexistent in France. I was not familiar with the associative sector, not in a deep way. The generosity of everyone shocked me.
Together, we accomplished something positive, and it was lovely to witness the children's smiles. With a bit more time, I believe we could have brought even more. In the end, what matters is that each of us did the best we could with the knowledge and experience we had. We accomplished something worthwhile. We sent teams to Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦, after which the Drohobych authorities contacted us, an association was established, and a twinning agreement was formed. In addition, a convoy is scheduled to depart in a few weeks.
Because of inexperience, there was a lot of improvisation, but the goal was accomplished.
